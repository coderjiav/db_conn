# db_conn
Header files based C++ database connection library.

This project is to create an easy to use, database agnostic, modular, and easily extendable C++ database connection library.

Currently only a native Sybase ASE driver is implemented, see sybase_example.cpp

If someone would like to contribute please ping me.
