# db_conn
Header files based C++ database connection library.

This project is to create an easy to use, database agnostic, modular, and easily extendable C++ database connection library.

At the moment this is work in progress and not a production-ready code that may have bugs!

Currently only a limited featured native Sybase driver is implemented, see sybase_example.cpp

If someone would like to contribute please ping me.

TODO:
- add support for more data types, stored procs, and cursor to Sybase driver
- write unit tests
- eventually add support for more databases
